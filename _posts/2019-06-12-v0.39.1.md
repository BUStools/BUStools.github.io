Changes from v0.38.0


This version adds three new subcommands

### `correct`

Corrects an input BUS file based on a tecnology specific whitelist of barcodes by matching barcodes at Hamming distance 1 (i.e. single substitution) when the change is unambiguous.

### `capture`

Given a set of target transcripts, `capture` will split an input BUS file into two parts based on whether a sequenced molecule is consistent with the target list or not. 

### `count`

Converts a sorted BUS file to a TCC matrix or a gene count matrix.

# Enhancements

### `sort`

Now uses external memory sort to limit memory usage
