Changes from v0.42.2.1 

- We now use a conditional mean for effective length estimation (rather than the overall mean) based on the frag length distribution
- Add `'aux/num_processed'` to H5
- Add [GFA](https://github.com/pmelsted/GFA-spec) file option to `'inspect'`
- Incorporate truncated gaussian in single-end datasets instead of only mean

It is recommended that users upgrade to this release for compatibility with [sleuth](http://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth)
