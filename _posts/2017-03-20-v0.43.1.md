Changes from v0.43.0

### fusions

kallisto can now find reads which span potential fusion breakpoints. The `quant` mode adds a `--fusion` flag which identifies read pairs involved in fusions and writes output to `fusion.txt`, this file is then processed by `pizzly` for downstream analysis.

### quant mode:

Switched to a uniform point for the EM algorithm that works better in highly ambiguous cases.

### pseudobam fixes

Several fixes to the pseudobam output so that the resulting SAM/BAM file can be validated with picard.

### Bug fixes

- updates kseq library, which would loop indefinitely on CRC corrupt gzipped files.
- warning when no reads pseudoalign and fixes crash (resulting output file will contain `nan` for tpm values)
