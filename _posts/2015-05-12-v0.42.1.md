This is version 0.42.1 of Kallisto. We recommend that users upgrade to this version.

Updates include

- `index`
    + now accepts multiple FASTA files and creates an index of all the targets
    + clips the polyA tail of transcripts that end with runs of A of length 10 or greater

- `quant`
    + now accepts multiple FASTQ paired-end files, or single-end files
    + `--single` flag to specify single-end reads
    + simplifies jumping rules
    + uses soft-intersect, if one read has no mapping k-mers the other end is used for pseudoalignment
    + outputs number of reads processed and number of reads pseudoaligned
