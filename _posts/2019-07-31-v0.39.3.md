This version adds new commands to bustools

### whitelist

`bustools whitelist` generates a whitelist based on the barcodes in a sorted BUS file.

### project

The kallisto bus command maps reads to a set of transcripts. `bustools project` takes as input a sorted BUS output and a transcript to gene map (tr2g file), and outputs a BUS file, a matrix.ec file, and a list of genes, which collectively map each read to a set of genes.

### linker

bustools linker removes specified section of barcode in BUS files.

### inspect

A report summarizing the contents of a sorted BUS file can be output either to standard out or to a JSON file for further analysis using bustools inspect.

### capture

The capture command has been updated to capture not only on a list of transcripts, but also a list of barcodes or UMIs. 

Some minor bugfixes
