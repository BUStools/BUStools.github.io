Changes from v0.42.5

### quant mode:

Quantification can now be run in strand specific mode. The experiment can either be `--fr-stranded`, when the first read is on the forward strand or `--rf-stranded` when the first read is on the second strand.

### pseudo mode:

- Improved multithreading when working with single cell data.
- A new UMI mode has been added which allows for efficient processing of UMI labelled single cell data.
