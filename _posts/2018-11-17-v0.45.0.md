Changes from v0.44.0

# BUS

`kallisto` can now process raw FASTQ files for single cell RNA-Seq and create an output in  [BUS format](https://github.com/BUStools/BUS) which can be further processed using [bustools](https://github.com/BUStools/bustools)

To process single cell data run `kallisto` with the `bus` command. To see a list of supported technologies, run with the `--list` option

```
> kallisto bus --list
