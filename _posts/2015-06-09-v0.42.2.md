This is version 0.42.2 of Kallisto. 

Updates include

- `index`
    + the index has been updated to include more of the transcript information
    + indices should be slightly smaller than before
    + indices constructed with previous versions will not work with this version, rerun your index command

- `quant`
    + Bootstraps can be run in multithreaded mode, use option `-t` to specify number of threads
    + If only one read of a paired end maps, `kallisto` will check the transcript positions to discard reads that would go outside of transcript given the mean fragment length.
    + Pseudobam. Pseudoalignments can now be output in SAM format to standard output. For more details on the output see [pseudobam]({{ site.url }}/kallisto/pseudobam.html)
    + Sequence specific bias. `kallisto` can learn a model for sequence specific bias and correct the abundances accordingly.
    + TSV. All output text files have been changed to `.tsv` ending.
