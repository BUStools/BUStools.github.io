A single-cell RNA-seq analysis utilizing __BUS__ format proceeds as follows:

1. Download data if it is not already present on the computer that will be usedfor processing and analysis. Single-cell RNA-seq data can be [located in the Gene Expression Omnibus and downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12504176/52777648-270c7200-2ff9-11e9-9a1d-2b14b0a79300.png).
2. Download and install __kallisto__ from the [__kallisto__ installation page](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/download).
3. Download and install __bustools__ from the [__bustools__ repository](https://github.com/BUStools/bustools).
4. Run the ["Getting Started" notebook]() which provides a complete workflow for downloading, quantifying and basic quality control of a single-cell RNA-seq dataset.


Other useful tutorial notebooks on the __BUStools__ repository include the [10x_hgmm_100 notebook](https://github.com/BUStools/BUS_notebooks_python/blob/master/dataset-notebooks/10x_hgmm_100_python/10x_hgmm_100.ipynb) which details the analysis of a small, and therefore easily downloadable dataset. Links to other tutorial notebooks are posted on the [__BUStools__ python notebook website](https://github.com/BUStools/BUS_notebooks_python) and the [__BUStools__ R notebook website](https://github.com/BUStools/BUS_notebooks_R).

Users who are interested in developing novel workflows based on __BUS__ files will find it helpful to start with a study of the [__BUS__ format](https://github.com/BUStools/BUS-format).
